# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
The application was failing to build on Vercel with the following TypeScript errors:
- `src/App.tsx(32,39): error TS6133: 'connectError' is declared but its value is never read`
- `src/App.tsx(36,16): error TS6133: 'isDeployPending' is declared but its value is never read`
- `src/App.tsx(37,16): error TS6133: 'isDeploySuccess' is declared but its value is never read`
- `src/App.tsx(38,14): error TS6133: 'isDeployError' is declared but its value is never read`
- `src/App.tsx(39,12): error TS6133: 'deployError' is declared but its value is never read`

## Root Cause
These errors occurred because variables were declared but never used in the code, which TypeScript's strict mode flags as errors.

## Solution

### 1. Removed Unused Variables
Removed the following unused variables from the component:
- `connectError` - was declared but never used
- `isDeployPending`, `isDeploySuccess`, `isDeployError`, `deployError` - were declared but not properly utilized

### 2. Properly Utilized Deployment Status Variables
Instead of just declaring the deployment status variables, we implemented proper usage:

1. **UI Feedback**: Added status messages in the modal components to show deployment progress:
   - Pending state: "Deploying [Contract] contract..."
   - Success state: "[Contract] contract deployed successfully!"
   - Error state: "Error: [error message]"

2. **Button States**: Disabled buttons during deployment to prevent multiple submissions

3. **Error Handling**: Properly displayed error messages to users

### 3. Added CSS Styles for Status Messages
Added new CSS classes for different status types:
- `.status-message.info` - for pending/neutral messages
- `.status-message.success` - for successful operations
- `.status-message.error` - for error messages

### 4. Updated Variable Names
Simplified the variable names from the destructured object:
- `isPending` instead of `isDeployPending`
- `isSuccess` instead of `isDeploySuccess`
- `isError` instead of `isDeployError`
- `error` instead of `deployError`

## Changes Made

### In App.tsx:
1. Removed unused `connectError` variable
2. Simplified deployment status variable names
3. Added UI elements to display deployment status in modals
4. Added proper error handling with try/catch blocks
5. Updated button states to reflect deployment progress

### In index.css:
1. Added CSS styles for status messages:
   ```css
   .status-message {
     padding: 0.75rem;
     border-radius: 8px;
     margin-bottom: 1rem;
     text-align: center;
     font-weight: 500;
   }
   
   .status-message.info {
     background: rgba(67, 233, 123, 0.2);
     border: 1px solid rgba(67, 233, 123, 0.3);
     color: #43e97b;
   }
   
   .status-message.success {
     background: rgba(67, 233, 123, 0.2);
     border: 1px solid rgba(67, 233, 123, 0.3);
     color: #43e97b;
   }
   
   .status-message.error {
     background: rgba(245, 87, 108, 0.2);
     border: 1px solid rgba(245, 87, 108, 0.3);
     color: #f5576c;
   }
   ```

## Testing
The fix was tested by running:
```bash
npm run build
```

The build now completes successfully without any TypeScript errors, making the application ready for deployment on Vercel.

## Impact
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- Improved user experience with deployment status feedback
- Maintained all existing functionality
- Enhanced error handling and user communication
